# Infinite-Scrolling-ListView
A simple Flutter app that displays a list of items. Users can tap the item to see a detailed view of it. Here I have used this API link https://picsum.photos/v2/list?page=pageNumber&amp;limit=20 (pageNumber will be an integer) to get a list of items with infinite scrolling. Each hit will contain 20 items. The list item will contain only the id and author. Full information can be found on the detail page. Here just showing the image URLs as clickable links not the full image.
